Additive manufacturing (AM) builds parts layer by layer, offering great design freedom and control over functional performance. At AMIL, we advance AM capabilities further by designing and printing stimuli-responsive (“smart”) materials for self-actuating or adaptive structures. Through combined experiments and computational modeling, we map the process-material-property relationships that govern print quality, mechanical strength, and overall performance of the final parts.
