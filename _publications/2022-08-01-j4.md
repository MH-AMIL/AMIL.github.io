4D printing of stimuli-responsive materials extends 3D printing by enabling the fabricated structures to transform their shapes and properties over time in response to external stimuli. Numerous research efforts have been dedicated to developing new smart materials, enhancing material printability, and ensuring time-evolving properties. Meanwhile, the use of smart materials and external stimuli in 4D printing has introduced the possibility of air emissions that can potentially deteriorate the indoor air quality at the workplace and pose continuous health hazards to users during the production and use phases. These potential air emissions caused by 4D printing have not yet been assessed in current literature, leading to unknown occupational hazards and human health effects. This study focuses on stereolithography-based 4D printing with constrained thermo-mechanics and builds an emission model to quantify the volatile organic compound emissions from printing, shape programming, and shape recovery stages. The established model mathematically links the emission characteristics with material compositional design and stimuli-response mechanisms.
