Material extrusion-based additive manufacturing is increasingly favored for its low-cost prototyping and widespread professional and domestic applications. This trend is fueled by accessible open-source printing hardware, firmware, and slicing software. Meanwhile, the evolution of technology, including diverse printing materials and process innovations, has prompted sustainability concerns. These include energy and material efficiency, emissions, health considerations, waste management, material circularity, and societal impacts. Although one chapter cannot comprehensively address all sustainability aspects, our aim is to develop a roadmap. This roadmap will highlight its manufacturing advantages supporting sustainability, raising awareness of challenges, and explore ongoing research for better solutions.
