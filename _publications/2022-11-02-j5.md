Evaluating the techno-economic feasibility is key to enhancing the technology readiness level of 4D printing. In the current literature, studies have been conducted to understand the 3D printing process mechanism and associated cost; however, they are not applicable to 4D printing due to the much-increased complexity of the intercorrelated relationships between material compositions, process parameters across multiple stages, the stimuli-response mechanisms along the added time dimension, and 4D printing cost. In this research, a techno-economic model is established to quantify the cost of 4D printing with methacrylate-based thermo-responsive polymers, embedded with explicit relations between cost and the material solidification chemistry and shape memory properties.
