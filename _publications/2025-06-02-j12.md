The growing demand for sustainable and safer energy storage solutions has driven increased interest in emerging battery technologies. While liquid-based lithium-ion batteries are widely adopted, concerns over safety, environmental impact, and the scarcity of critical raw materials have prompted a shift toward solid-state alternatives. With higher energy density, greater inherent stability, and improved sustainability, solid-state batteries present a compelling alternative. However, quantitative assessments of their environmental impacts across different life cycle phases remain limited. This study conducts a life cycle assessment to evaluate the environmental performance of pyrite-based solid-state batteries with scaled-up production for energy storage applications, considering cradle-to-gate and cradle-to-use phases...
