4D printing has emerged as a promising manufacturing technology in recent years and revolutionized products by adding shape-morphing capabilities when exposed to certain stimuli. Increasing research attention has been dedicated to studying the shape memory behaviors of the 4D fabricated structures. However, in-depth discussions on quantifying the influence of process parameters on shape fixity and recovery properties are limited, and the anisotropy induced by the layer-wise fabrication nature is significantly underreported. To further exploit the shape memory property of 4D printed structures, it is essential to investigate the process-induced anisotropic shape memory behaviors. In this study, the effects of critical process parameters on anisotropy in shape memory properties are mathematically quantified; meanwhile, the feasibility of tailoring the anisotropy of 4D printed parts is examined with joint consideration of total build time. Different scanning patterns are experimentally analyzed for their influence on anisotropic behaviors.
