Additive manufacturing of stimuli-responsive materials, that is, 4D printing, has recently drawn attention given its unique ability to fabricate smart structures that can change shape over time when triggered by external stimuli. Despite numerous efforts toward understanding the shape memory characteristics of 4D-printed structures, the comprehensive characterization of their critical quality metrics, such as surface quality, remains limited. This study employs a combined approach of mathematical modeling and experimental characterization to investigate the surface roughness changes of 4D-printed thermo-responsive shape memory structures, considering the impacts of both printing parameters and stimulus conditions across consecutive shape-morphing cycles...
